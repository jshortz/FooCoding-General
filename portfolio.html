        <p class="weeks">In <a href='https://jshortz.github.io/hyf-html-css/week1/index.html' target="_blank">Week 1</a>, we were asked to create a 
        basic CV. I chose to create one for Sherlock Holmes rather than myself. At this point, we'd studied some basic HTML
        and minimal CSS.</p>
        <p class="weeks">Our <a href="https://jshortz.github.io/hyf-html-css/week2/index.html" target="_blank">Week 2</a> homework was about making grids 
          with float: left and flex-box (I personally find flex-box easier to use).</p>
        <p class="weeks">In <a href="https://jshortz.github.io/hyf-html-css/week3/index.html" target="_blank">Week 3</a>, we created a responsive website 
        from scratch. I chose to make an homage to the adorable Tarepanda.</p>

        <p class="weeks"><a href="https://github.com/jshortz/animals">Week 1</a> of JavaScript 1 was focused on basic concepts and learning to push, pull,
        and merge with git. This homework reflects the git portion of the lesson.</p>
        <p class="weeks">In <a href="https://github.com/jshortz/hyf-js1/tree/master/week2">Week 2</a>, we focused on concepts like strings, arrays, 
        variable types, rounding, and escape characters.</p>
        <p class="weeks"><a href="https://github.com/jshortz/hyf-js1/tree/master/week3">Week 3</a> of JavaScript 1 focused on introducing functions,
        array methods, objects, and deeper manipulation of JavaScript variables and objects.</p>

        <p class="weeks"><a href="https://github.com/jshortz/JavaScript2/tree/week1homework/Week1/homework/">Week 1</a>
        of JavaScript 2 involved weaving together JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, specifically by manipulating HTML DOM elements/nodes 
        with JavaScript. Although it's not reflected in the homework, we also learned about event listeners. This week, we also 
        started submitting our homework via pull requests.</p>
        <p class="weeks"><a href="https://github.com/jshortz/JavaScript2/tree/HomeworkWeek2/Week2/homework">Week 2</a> of JavaScript 2
        was all about higher-order functions. The homework asks us to use .map and .filter on arrays to produce results. I chose to also 
        do the optional reduce on an array.</p>
        <p class="weeks"><a href="https://github.com/jshortz/JavaScript2/tree/Week3Homework/Week3/homework">Week 3</a> had us doing a 
        variety of tasks, mostly related to functions and arrays. We also experimented a little bit with timeouts.</p>
